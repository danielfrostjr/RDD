# RDD

This repository is used for a regression discontinuity design project in the UT Austin MA Econ class, Causal Inference, taught by Professor Scott Cunningham. The goal is to replicate the results of Benjamin Hanson's paper, Punishment and Deterrence: Evidence from Drunk Driving in the AER. The assignment can be found under /Writing/. The PDF output can be generated by first running "/Do/Replication_1_Startup.do" in Stata, then running "/Do/move_files.bat" to place it in the correct directory.
